# Chris Stephens Portfolio
I try to update this as much as possible so the date at the top of my <a href="nulllDev.github.io" target="_blank">portfolio page</a> is most likely accurate.

###### **(At the time of writing this, most projects are in extremely early stages of development. Some are still in the planning stage but are intended to have a landing page in the near future. The reason for having those types of projects on my portfolio is to show visitors what I have in mind for the future.)**

I'm **always** open to hear your criticisms or advice on what I can do to improve my work, which you can do by clicking any of my social links and sending me a direct message or [emailing me](mailto:stephenschriswork@gmail.com).

**Thank you** for taking a look at my portfolio as well as taking the time to read this!

If you have any questions I'd love to answer them!

<summary>Common Questions</summary>
<br>
Q: Why is your porftolio page so simple? It doesn't exactly show off your skills...
<br>
A: I prefer to display my skillset through my projects. Therefore, my portfolio page acts as a glossary, which makes it easier to navigate.
