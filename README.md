# Chris Stephens Portfolio
I try to update this as much as possible so the date at the top of my portfolio page is most likely accurate.

###### **(At the time of writing this, most projects are in extremely early stages of development. Some are still in the planning stage but are intended to have a landing page in the near future.)**

I'm **always** open to hear your criticisms or advice on what I can do to improve my work, which you can do by clikcing any of my social links and sending me a direct message or email.

**Thank you** for taking a look at my portfolio as well as taking the time to read this!

If you have any questions I'd love to answer them!
